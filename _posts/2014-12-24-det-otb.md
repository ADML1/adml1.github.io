The DET Wings are in need of a 1B.  We are also in need of a starting C.

We will move any SP (Burnett, M.Gonzalez, C. Morton) and RP available as well.  Depending on the player involve wwill consider moving my 1st, 2nd, or 3rd round pick depending on the player(s) offered.
We are prepared to jump on reasonable offer as the clock is ticking to the cut deadline.

Any other offer will be considered

Jake
DET Wings
