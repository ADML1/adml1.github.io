Although the Dragoons have some nice pitching, we are not ready to battle the best in ADML1.  Therefore, any and all players are marketable for:

- 2016 picks
- replacement stats
- young players with promise

Are you tired of the Gorillas and ATX, and their most evil managers, always at the top of the heap?  He, he!  Well do something about it!

All offers but Frank's will be responded to.  No one told when I became the Commish that my team would immediately take a power dive into the dregs.
