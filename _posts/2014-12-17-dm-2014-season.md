[Diamond Mind 2014 Annual Season Database](http://www.diamond-mind.com/servlet/the-167/2014-Annual-Season-Databsase/Detail)

The 2014 baseball season may go down in history as the “year of the pitcher.” Corey Kluber of the Indians and Clayton Kershaw of the Dodgers baffled opposing batters to win the Cy Young Award in their respective leagues.  The powerful bullpens of the Royals and the Giants propelled them to a dramatic Game Seven World Series showdown.  Meanwhile, young Angels slugger Mike Trout captured his first MVP in the American League, while Kershaw breezed to the National League award.  Altogether, the 2014 MLB season offered the baseball fan outstanding performances on the mound and at the plate, the debut of rookies like Jason deGrom and Jose Abreu, and, of course, tight pennant races.  DMB is proud to present this historic season in our new version 11 or version 10 format.  

 The 2014 Annual Deluxe Season contains everything you need to play games using teams and players from the 2014 season -- a full set of ratings and statistics for every player who appeared in the big leagues that year, plus team rosters, manager profiles, ballpark ratings, and league schedules. Statistics include official batting, pitching and fielding totals with left/right splits for all batters and pitchers.
