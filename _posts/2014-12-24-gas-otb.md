The following players will be available for a draft pick.  Since there is very little offense available in the draft, I am sure somebody could use them!  :-)

- Jason Castro, C
- Brandon Moss, 1B
- Mark Teixeira, 1B
- Alejandro De Aza, OF
- Torii Hunter, OF
- Alfredo Simon, SP
- Tim Hudson, SP
- Daniel Robertson, CL

The following players are available, but for a combination of younger players and draft pick(s):

- Yan Gomes, C
- Joey Votto, 1B
- Brandon Phillips, 2B
- Ryan Zimmerman, 1B/3B/LF
- Jeff Samardzija, SP
- Francisco Liriano, SP
- Chad Allen, CL

Offers are preferred, but inquiries welcome.
