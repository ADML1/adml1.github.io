No longer available.

All,
First I must apologize strongly but I misstated my needs in my email letting you know that pick 1.6 was available.
 
I misread the positions on my db and it turns out I do not need a SS as Jordy Mercer was full time there. I thought he had a second base rating but it turns out he does not.
 
My real needs are at 2nd base, outfield and starting pitching.
 
As I was looking over all the offers I got I realized my mistake and again I apologize.
 
I would want to fill 2 of the needs with the pick so if you are interested please send another offer. I guess I had a senior moment as I am turning 65 in the near future.


All,
The Maulers are offering up the 6th pick in the upcoming draft.
My needs are: Full time SS with decent numbers, Upgrade to my Outfield and starting pitching.
 
All offers will be considered and responded to.
