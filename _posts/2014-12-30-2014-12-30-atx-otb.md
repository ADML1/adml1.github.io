With two starters sent packing today, the OTB needs an update. Here's the new one.

If you see a good fit, then I'm interested in discussing trades possibilities for either of these guys:

* Cano - 665 PA, 314/384/454
* Encarnacion - 542 PA, 34 HR

These guys are open to new homes:

* Haren
* Rasmus
* Belt

Needs:

* a SS who isn't retiring next year
* a C who didn't miss the year with an injury

Also looking for:

* Draft picks
* Replacement 2B if I move Cano. 
* Have any relief pitchers you'd like to cash in? I have plenty of relief that isn't the quality I need. I'm open to swapping picks and pitchers, resulting in putting you in a better drafting position.

Make an offer if you wish or simply let me know that you're interested. I am happy to make the first suggestions.
