>After acquiring pick #1, the Slug’n Hurl are making it available for trade.  1B hole WILL be filled with the pick, however, “intriguing” trade offers will be considered.

The Slug’n Hurl is looking to replace a “slug”.  Since Prince “Big Mac” Fielder decided to take a “vacation” this year, I am in need of a fulltime 1B.  Most notable available for trade:
                                        
- Josh Harrison
- Neil Walker
- Adrian Beltre
- Junior Lake
- Leonys Martin
- Nick Castellenos
- Pick 1.12

Don’t need a 1B on the backside of a career.  Just someone who is equal in value to whomever is selected from the list above.
