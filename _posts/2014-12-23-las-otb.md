Las Cruces has lots of catchers on the roster. Could trade Mike Zunino and Tyler Flowers. 

Zunino, the youngster, is more expensive. He's got a Vg arm and Vg power both ways. It was his first year as a full timer. I picked him at 2.4 last year, so it'll take a 1st to get him.

Flowers is White Sox starting catcher. Will take a 3rd.

Happy holidays, all.
