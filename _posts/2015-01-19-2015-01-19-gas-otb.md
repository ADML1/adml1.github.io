If you missed out on adding that quality starting pitcher in the draft, GAS has 60+ extra GS to move!  

The GS number provided below has been adjusted per ADML rules:

- RHP Tanner Roark, 2.85 ERA, 34 GS
- RHP Jeff Samardzija, 2.99 ERA, 34 GS
- RHP Mat Latos, 3.25 ERA, 18 GS (traded from CIN hitters haven to MIA)
- LHP Francisco Liriano, 3.38 ERA, 32 GS
- RHP Alfredo Simon, 3.44 ERA, 34 GS (traded from CIN hitters haven to DET)
- RHP Tim Hudson, 3.57 ERA, 34 GS
- RHP Rafael Montero, 4.06 ERA, 8 GS
- RHP Matt Cain, 4.18 ERA, 17 GS
- RHP Jarrod Parker (NC)

Some of these guys will be easier to trade (Simon and Hudson).  Interested in young hitters, pitchers and picks.  I can also add somebody like Joey Votto, Torii Hunter or Brandon Phillips if I like the proposed upgrade.  Offers are preferred, but inquiries welcome.
