Holland Marsh have a bunch of decent? players available who may or may not make the cut. If interested I'll deal them for a pick upgrade.

- John Danks - 32 mediocre starts.
- Nick Tepesch - 22 mediocre starts.
- Brian Matusz - decent situational lefty.
- Marc Rzepczynski - see Matusz description.
- TJ McFarland - he amassed a 2.74 era. It's a bit of a mystery because he wasn't particularly effective at getting people out. The 70% GB rate may be why.
- Chris Stewart - decent backup catcher.
- Mitch Moreland - facing a crossroads. Perhaps he should look into PEDs?
- Mark Reynolds - 22 bombs and added RF to his resume.
- Nick Swisher - The wheels fell off this wagon in 2014. A decent gamble that he may have something left.

Also I'm still interested in moving Zach Greinke for a big bat. In addition I'll swap either Chris Archer, Alex Cobb, Gerrit Cole, Drew Smyly or Carlos Carrasco for a young bat of similar worth.

Thanks,
Paul
