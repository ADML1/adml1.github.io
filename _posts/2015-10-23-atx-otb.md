If any of these players are of interest to you, feel welcome to make a proposal or just let me know you're interested. I'm happy to look over rosters and explore ideas.

It's time to reset to the roster and after a few successful years came to an ugly end in Round 2. While I am still looking for quality trades, I'm much more likely to say yes to deals when previously I would hang onto players.

As I'm entering rebuilding mode, I'm looking for top picks/prospects or trade chips with value I can use to get them.

The numbers below are their real numbers, not the inflated numbers you can use as allowed by our ADML1 usage rules.

## SPs

[Johnny Cueto](http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/cuetojo01.shtml?mobile=false)
 - 32 GS, great stats until some hiccups after the trade to KC.

[Dan Haren](http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/h/harenda01.shtml)
 - 32 GS, solid overall numbers

[Michael Fiers](http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/f/fiersmi01.shtml)
- 30 GS, also good overall numbers 

*Random Note: All three of these guys were traded to teams who made the playoffs. Time for me to trade them too, and hopefully they'll pitch for you in the playoffs!*


## RPs 

[Andrew Miller](http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/millean01.shtml)
- 246 BF, not career year like last year, but still a great season as NYY's closer.

[Dave Robertson](http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/roberda08.shtml)
- 250 BF, another solid season as CHW's closer.

[Jason Grilli](http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/g/grillja01.shtml)
- 140 BF, back to form with a good season has ATL's closer.

[A.J. Ramos](http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/ramosaj01.shtml)
- 277 BFs, getting better every year and how the Marlin's closer. If there is one RP I want to keep it is him, but I can't justify keeping a closer with the likely roster next year. 

[Brian Matusz](http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/matusbr01.shtml)
- 206 BF, getting better each year and now death against lefties.


## Offense

[Derek Norris, C](http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/n/norride01.shtml)
- 557 PA and still crushing LHPs.

[Edwin Encarnacion, 1B/DH](http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/e/encared01.shtml)
 - 624 PA and a 4th straight season of 900+ OPS and power

[Robinson Cano, 2B](http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/canoro01.shtml)
- 674 PAs, like Ramos I'd normally prefer to keep him, but this is the year to move him to a new home.

[Colby Rasmus, OF](http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/rasmuco01.shtml)
- 485 PA, solid year overall

[Justin Upton, LF/RF](http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/u/uptonju01.shtml)
 - 620 PA, decent season, but... San Diego isn't kind to offensive numbers.

Matt Weiters, C
- Returned from injury. Likely to keep him rather than sell too low unless someone has a great trade proposal.

Branson Moss, 1B/OF
- Like Weiters, I'll likely keep him due to not having a great year unless someone wants to roll the dice on him.


## Warm Bodies

I'm likely to cut these guys, so I'm happy to throw them into a deal if they can be of use to you.

- Cory Rasmus 
- Rafael Soriano 
- Rex Brothers
- Jason De Fratus
- Barnhart C
- Santiago, SS
- Kouzmanoff
- Fuld, OF
