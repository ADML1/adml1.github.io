It's good to see the activity level rising! As it seems we have entered into the Happy OTB Holiday season, now is a good time to update mine. 

If you see a good fit, then I'm interested in discussing trades possibilities for any of these guys:

* Kershaw - 27 GS, 1.77 ERA, 0.857 WHIP
* Cueto - 34 GS, 2.25 ERA, 0.960 WHIP
* Cano - 665 PA, 314/384/454
* Encarnacion - 542 PA, 34 HRs
* Longoria - 700 PA

These guys are open to new homes:

* Latos
* Haren
* Rasmus
* Belt

Looking for:

* SS and CF
* Draft picks
* Replacement 2B or 3B respectively if I move Cano or Longoria. 

Make an offer if you wish or simply let me know that you're interested. I am happy to make the first suggestions.
